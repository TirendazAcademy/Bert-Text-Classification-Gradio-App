This project aims to show how to perform an end-to-end text classification project. To do this, I used [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) for fine-tuning the BERT model,  [Comet ML](https://www.comet.com/site/products/llmops/) for monitoring hyperparameters and the app, and [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/docs/interface) for building the text classification app.

You can look at this app on [my HuggingFace space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Tirendaz/Text-Classification)
